       <h1>Welcome!</h1>
                <p>I am a software developer focused on web development programs as 
                    well as in both desktop and mobile devices. I'm always interested 
                    in learning about new technologies to expand my overview of the tools 
                    that I have at my disposal. Besides, I adapt easily to the development 
                    environment where I am going to work and also I am self-taught person.</p>        
        <div class="well well-sm">
            「Do you think it's cool not to smile? If you go through life like that though, 
            you wouldn't notice. You can't be close to being a Minus like that. Even if things don't go the way 
            you want them to. Even if you lose. Even if you don't win. Even if you look like an idiot. Even 
            if you're walked on. Even if you're kicked. Even if you're sad. Even if you're bitter. Even if you're 
            tired of it all. Even if it hurts. Even if it's hard. Even if you're weak. Even if you aren't right. 
            Even if you're humble. Through all of that, we Minus always laugh.」<br>
